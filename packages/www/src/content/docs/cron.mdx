# Cron 

Cron is a coffee subscription where each month you'll receive a
special bag of coffee themed around the topics and memes that drive
tech culture.

## Subscribe to Cron

In order to subscribe to Cron, you'll start by pasting the below
command into your terminal:
```sh
ssh terminal.shop
```

:::vhs-png[The Terminal SSH shop]

Now navigate to `cron` and hit `Enter`.

This will take you to the checkout flow where you can provide your 
mailing address and payment info.

:::vhs-png[Cron checkout]
Enter
Sleep 5s

:::note
All cron orders are processed on the first of each month.
You won't be charged until your first box ships out!

Once you've finished this flow, you should see a confirmation page,
and you're all set! 

## Manage subscription

You can manage your subscription from inside the SSH store.
Hit `a` to navigate to the account settings page after you SSH in,
and then navigate to `subscriptions`.

:::vhs[account settings]

From there you can cancel your subscription by pressing `x` or `delete`.
